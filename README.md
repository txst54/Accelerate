## About The Project

Accelerate redefines driver's education by merging interactive learning with gaming, utilizing the Roblox platform to do so. Students can learn through interesting modules which cover diverse topics related to driving techniques and safety, practicing in virtual environments while instructors can monitor progress remotely. This project was made for the FormulaHacks Hackathon at the University of Texas at Austin, in March 2024. The project idea was inspired by the Hackathon's theme of driving and two of the sponsors, being Roblox and PropelAuth.

## Usage

This project may be used in the virtual aspect of driver's education. The information presented in the modules combined with the virtual driving environment engage the students and allow them to fundamentally grasp the driving concepts that are key to their ability to keep themselves and the roads safe. Our virtual environment gives people the most flexibility with learning driving concepts and allows them to choose lessons and instruction that best fits their schedule.
